## Terminologies

### Jira, Epic & Story

Jira is an industry-standard tool for tracking progress of (not limited to) software projects. An Epic is usually used for entire initiatives, while a Story is a smaller unit of work with more specific instructions.

### Model

Models describe how information is organized, transmitted or stored.

### Database / Storage / Persistence

Database, storage and persistence are often used interchangeably. They represent the component we use to store and access information for the application.

### CRUD

CRUD stands for actions of creation, read, update & deletion.
